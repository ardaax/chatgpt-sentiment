# chatgpt-sentiment

This repo is for generating a csv file which contains the public sentiment towards ChatGPT using ~48.000 tweets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/konradb/chatgpt-the-tweets). Note that the dataset gets updated and the dataset may be outdated. To make the sentiment classification [cardiffnlp's twitter roberta-base-sentiment](https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest) model from the hugging face is used.


Here is the final result
